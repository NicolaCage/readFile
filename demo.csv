<p>In this dataset, we will use the visual graph exploration tool Nebula Explorer to explore the publicly available data relationships in Game of Thrones.</p>

<h2 id=""details"">Details.</h2>
<p>""Game of Thrones"" is a TV series that everyone likes very much, and the wonderfully complex character relationships are a very good case study for exploring people and their relationships.</p>
<p>The traditional table format can not intuitively reflect the scale of the relationship, while the graph format can very easily reflect the complexity of the relationship, and quickly dig the relationship between the characters.</p>
<p>Complexity of this dataset: _______</p>
<p>The structure of this dataset, as shown in the figure:<br></p>

<li><p>At this time, click the random import button in the pop-up box, and you can already explore the canvas.
<img src=""img/game-of-thrones-2.png"" alt=""Game_of_thrones"" /></p></li>
<li><p>But in this step, we manually import some famous characters, copy the names below, and click ""ADD"" to add the points to the canvas.

</ul>
<pre><code>Daenerys-Targaryen
Eddard-Stark
Jon-Snow
Tyrion-Lannister
Robert-Baratheon
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>At this point we can already see several red dots corresponding to the characters displayed in the canvas, so we right-click and modify the color of each dot individually for our subsequent analysis

<li><p>On the left side, select the property display option, check person.name and click OK, so that the names of all points are displayed.

<li><p>Here we select the middle imp Tyrion-Lannister, tap the left expansion panel, configure the parameters of the panel, here we select the direction as bidirectional, customize the color of the expansion, we select the same green color as the imp, then click the expand button.

<li><p>At this point we can already see the character relationships associated with this point.

<li><p>Similarly we can see the relationships of the female dragon lady, the male lead Jon-Snow, and the others.

<p>We can learn in the results, who has richer interpersonal relationships, already which people are in which camps, the size of family relationships, etc.</p>
