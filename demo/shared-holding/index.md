This is a generated dataset with two kinds of vertices and four kinds of edges(relationships):

person can hold a corp in {share} %
person can be relative with another person
corp can hold another corp in {share} %
corp can be a branch of another corp
person can be as a role of a corp

Within the playground, you can visually explore the shareholding data from select vertices(i.e. "c_132" with the name "Chambers LLC") by selecting:

![studio_explore_0](https://nebula-website-cn.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/nebula-website/images/demo/shared-holding/studio_explore_0.png)

click this explored vertex dot, then you can explore from select vertices by selecting:

- Edge Type
- Direction
- Steps
- Query Limit(Optional)

> note, you can click the üëÅÔ∏è icon to add options to show fields of the graph,

![studio_explore_1](https://nebula-website-cn.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/nebula-website/images/demo/shared-holding/studio_explore_1.png)

After clicking Expand, you will see all queried relations with c_132 the Chambers LLC.

Alternatively, you could query nGQL via console like:

```ngql
GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM "c_132" over * BIDIRECT;
```
